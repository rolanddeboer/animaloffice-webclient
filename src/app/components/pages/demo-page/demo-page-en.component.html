        <h3>What is Animal Office?</h3>
      </header>
      <main>
        <p>
          Animal Office is a software application for small animal exhibition shows. The purpose of Animal Office is to make entering participants into the show as easy and fast as possible, for the exhibitors as well as for the show organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is designed such that only the acknowledged breeds and colors can be chosen. The advantage of this is that always the correct names are used, and the animals are always in the right order at the show.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the entry period, exhibitors and others who are interested can consult the statistics page on the Animal Office website (or through a link on the own website of the show), to see which breeds and amounts have been signed up for the show. Our experience is that exhbitors are particularly interested in this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Animal Office is meant to be used together with your current administration software. After the entry period closes, all data can be automatically transferred into your administration program.
